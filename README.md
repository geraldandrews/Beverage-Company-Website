### Programs Used: GIMP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
### Date Created: 2020

## Description:
I was inspired to create this website in memory of a beverage company I worked at for 13 years before it closed. I designed this website from scratch using HTML and CSS for the layout and responsiveness of the website and Javascript for the functionality of the mobile navigation on tablets and smartphones. I used GIMP to create some of the images on the site and I used AOS JS(Animate On Scroll library) for the animations with some of the images on the website.
